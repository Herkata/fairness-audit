</div>

This playbook provides a structured, lifecycle-aligned framework for auditing and governing fairness in AI systems.

It integrates four core components:

1. **Historical Context Assessment**  
2. **Fairness Definition Selection**  
3. **Bias Source Identification & Prioritization**  
4. **Comprehensive Metrics & Monitoring**  

Each component feeds directly into the next, forming a traceable and defensible workflow.

## **General Guidelines**

> 📢 **Awareness** — Identify ethical considerations early and revisit them throughout the process.
>
> 📝 **Documentation** — Record decisions and justify them to ensure transparency and accountability.
>
> 🚀 **Action** — Use ethical reflection to inform concrete implementation choices.
>
> ⚖️ **Fairness vs. Performance** — If performance gains require sacrificing relevant ethical practices, treat the gains as unattainable.
>
> 💡 **Values** — Check solutions against organizational and personal values while working through the questionnaire.
>
> 🔍 **Transparency** — Explain decisions in a way others can follow and audit.
>
> 🌫️ **No Perfect Solution** — State why you chose for or against specific ethical practices.
>
> 🚧 **Limitations** — When no quick fix exists, document and emphasize solution limitations.

This section establishes accountability, documentation discipline, and a structured foundation for the fairness audit process.

---

## **D.1 Fairness Definition Selection**

This section explains:

1. **Which outputs to extract from the Historical Context Assessment**
2. **How to use those outputs inside the Fairness Definition Selection Tool**

This walkthrough assumes the Historical Context Assessment has already been completed.

---

### D.1.1 Required Inputs from Historical Context Assessment

Before entering the Definition Selection Decision Tree, extract and document:

#### D.1.1.1 Documented Historical Outcome Bias
- Evidence of systematic exclusion
- Discriminatory access patterns
- Structural under-representation
- Biased historical decision outcomes

**Output to carry forward:**
- `Historical Outcome Bias: Yes / No`
- Short justification summary

---

#### D.1.1.2 Identified Harm Types
- Who was harmed?
- What type of harm occurred? (denial of access, misclassification, reputational damage, financial loss, etc.)
- Which error type historically drove harm (False Negatives or False Positives)?

**Output to carry forward:**
- `Primary Harm Type`
- `Most Severe Error Type: FN / FP / Both`

---

#### D.1.1.3 Protected and Intersectional Groups
- Individual protected attributes
- High-risk intersectional combinations

**Output to carry forward:**
- List of protected groups
- List of intersectional groups requiring monitoring

---

#### D.1.1.4 Risk Severity Level
- Overall structural risk classification (Low / Medium / High)

**Output to carry forward:**
- `Risk Level`

---

### D.1.2 Steps in the Fairness Definition Selection Tool

Using the extracted inputs, proceed through the tool in order.

---

#### D.1.2.1 Historical Bias Check

Input: `Historical Outcome Bias`

- If **Yes** → Add **Demographic Parity** as a primary fairness constraint.
- If **No** → Document reasoning and continue.

---

#### D.1.2.2 Error Harm Alignment

Input: `Most Severe Error Type`

- If **False Negatives dominate harm** → Select **Equal Opportunity**
- If **False Positives dominate harm** → Select **Predictive Parity**
- If **Both cause severe harm** → Select **Equalized Odds**

This anchors fairness selection to harm severity identified earlier.

---

#### D.1.2.3 Score Exposure Check

Determine whether the system outputs:
- Risk scores
- Probabilities
- Rankings

If **scores are exposed or interpreted**, add:
- **Sufficiency / Group Calibration** (secondary metric)

If not, skip.

---

#### D.1.2.4 Individual-Level Fairness Requirement

Based on system context and risk level:

If decisions are:
- High-stakes
- Individually consequential
- Likely to raise perceived unfairness

Add:
- **Fairness Through Awareness**

---

#### D.1.2.5 Intersectional Enforcement

Using the protected group list:

- Ensure all selected fairness metrics will be computed for:
  - Each protected group
  - Each high-risk intersectional subgroup

Intersectional monitoring is mandatory when risk level is Medium or High.

---

#### D.1.2.6 Conflict Review & Prioritization

Before finalizing:

- Check for known incompatibilities between selected definitions.
- Evaluate expected fairness–performance trade-offs.
- Prioritize metrics based on:
  - Structural risk level
  - Harm severity
  - Regulatory exposure

Document:

- Primary fairness definitions
- Secondary monitoring metrics
- Explicit trade-offs accepted

---

### D.1.3 Final Output of This Stage

The Fairness Definition Selection Tool must produce:

- A finalized list of fairness definitions
- Primary vs. secondary classification
- Explicit linkage to historical findings
- Confirmation of intersectional evaluation
- Documentation of expected trade-offs

These outputs feed directly into the Bias Source Identification phase.

## **B.1 Bias Source Identification & Prioritization**

This section explains how to move systematically from identifying bias types to detecting and prioritizing them.


### B.1.1 Taxonomy Stage – Identify Relevant Bias Types

#### B.1.1.1 Review the Bias Taxonomy

Start by reviewing your full taxonomy (e.g., historical, representation, measurement, aggregation, learning, evaluation, deployment, interaction, feedback).

#### B.1.1.2 Narrow to Plausible Categories

Ask:

- Which bias categories are most plausible in this application?
- Which align with documented historical risks?
- Which threaten your selected fairness definitions?

The objective is to reduce the universe of possible risks to those most relevant to your system.

**Output:**  
A shortlist of applicable bias categories.

---

### B.1.2 Detection Stage – Conduct Targeted Analysis

#### B.1.2.1 Apply Bias-Specific Detection Methods

For each shortlisted bias type:

- Apply appropriate qualitative and quantitative detection methods.
- Disaggregate findings by protected and intersectional groups.
- Compare results against historical findings and selected fairness metrics.
- Document evidence and assumptions clearly.

Detection must be aligned with:

- Historical context  
- Selected fairness definitions  
- Application risk level  

**Output:**  
A documented list of identified bias sources (including ruled-out risks with justification).

---

### B.1.3 Evaluation Stage – Assess Each Bias Source

#### B.1.3.1 Score Across Standardized Dimensions

For each confirmed or suspected bias source, assign 1–5 scores for:

- Severity  
- Scope  
- Persistence  
- Historical Alignment  
- Intervention Feasibility  

This creates a structured evaluation baseline.

**Output:**  
A completed scoring table for all identified bias sources.

---

### B.1.4 Prioritization Stage – Calculate Priority Scores

#### B.1.4.1 Apply the Weighted Formula

Use the defined weighted scoring formula to generate a Priority Score for each bias source.

This ensures prioritization is:

- Structured  
- Transparent  
- Comparable across bias types  

**Output:**  
Ranked list of bias sources by Priority Score.

---

### B.1.5 Resource Allocation – Categorize and Act

#### B.1.5.1 Assign Priority Levels

Group bias sources into:

- **High Priority** → Immediate mitigation required  
- **Medium Priority** → Planned mitigation and monitoring  
- **Low Priority** → Ongoing monitoring  

#### B.1.5.2 Align Mitigation Planning

Allocate resources and define mitigation timelines according to priority level.

**Output:**  
Mitigation roadmap aligned with ranked risks.

---

### B.1.6 Final Outcome

By following this workflow:

1. Taxonomy defines *what could go wrong*  
2. Detection reveals *what is happening*  
3. Evaluation measures *how serious it is*  
4. Prioritization determines *what must be addressed first*  

This creates a traceable and defensible bias management process from identification to action.

## **M.1 Comprehensive Metrics Evaluation**

The Fairness Metrics Tool enables engineering and data science teams to systematically select, calculate, visualize, and interpret fairness metrics for AI systems. It links fairness definitions to quantitative evaluation, incorporates statistical validation, and supports reporting and governance decisions across both group-level and individual-level fairness concerns.

This guide outlines how to apply the tool in a consistent, reproducible, and actionable manner.

### M.1.1 Define the Scope

- Identify the AI system, model, or process under evaluation.
- Specify protected attributes (e.g., race, gender, age) and relevant intersectional groups.
- Confirm fairness objectives from prior stages:
	- Historical Context Assessment
	- Selected Fairness Definitions
	- Identified Bias Sources

---

### M.1.2 Select Metrics

Map fairness definitions to appropriate quantitative metrics:

- **Statistical Parity (Demographic Parity)** – Equal representation of outcomes  
- **Equal Opportunity (True Positive Rate Parity)** – Fair treatment of qualified individuals  
- **Equalized Odds** – Balanced false positives and false negatives  
- **Predictive Parity (Positive Predictive Value Parity)** – Consistent meaning of positive predictions  
- **Similarity-Based / Individual Fairness** – Similar individuals treated similarly  
- **Intersectional & Multi-Dimensional Metrics** – Subgroup-level fairness evaluation  

Prioritize **primary metrics** for enforcement and use **secondary metrics** for monitoring complementary fairness dimensions.

---

### M.1.3 Prepare the Dataset

- Ensure protected attributes and outcomes are clearly labeled.
- Address missing demographic data using proxy analysis or sensitivity checks.
- For small subgroups, use Bayesian or hierarchical methods for stable estimates.

---

### M.1.4 Calculating Metrics

#### M.1.4.1 Compute Point Estimates

- Apply selected metrics to obtain baseline disparity values.
- Use standard definitions or task-specific adjustments as needed.

---

#### M.1.4.2 Quantify Uncertainty

- Generate confidence intervals via bootstrapping, exact tests, or Bayesian methods.
- Report intervals alongside all point estimates.

---

#### M.1.4.3 Assess Statistical Significance

- Define null hypothesis (no disparity).
- Compute p-values and adjust for multiple testing (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg).
- Apply escalation tiers:
	- **0.99** – Immediate action  
	- **0.95** – Investigation required  
	- **0.90** – Monitoring  

---

#### M.1.4.4 Check Robustness

- Perform cross-validation across data splits or time periods.
- Conduct sensitivity analyses under alternative assumptions or simulated shifts.

---

### M.1.5 Visualization and Reporting

#### M.1.5.1 Generate Visualizations

- **Fairness Disparity Chart** – Group disparities with confidence intervals  
- **Intersectional Heatmap** – Subgroup-level disparities  
- **Pareto Diagrams** – Trade-offs between fairness and technical metrics  
- **Trade-Off Scatter Plot** – Performance vs. fairness comparison  
- **Threshold Alert Charts** – Escalation-level monitoring  

---

#### M.1.5.2 Reporting Structure

- **Executive Summary** – Key findings and high-risk disparities  
- **Metric Table** – Estimates, confidence intervals, significance levels  
- **Visualization Section** – Supporting charts  
- **Recommendations** – Mitigation or monitoring actions  

---

### M.1.6 Interpretation and Decision-Making

- **Primary Metrics** – Focus on statistically significant disparities exceeding thresholds.  
- **Secondary Metrics** – Monitor trends and intersectional behavior.  
- **Trade-Off Analysis** – Balance fairness objectives against performance constraints.  
- **Documentation** – Record assumptions, thresholds, limitations, and decisions.

---

### M.1.7 Tips for Effective Use

- Start with group-level metrics, then analyze intersectional and individual fairness.
- Always visualize uncertainty to avoid over-interpreting small differences.
- Adjust escalation thresholds to align with regulatory or organizational priorities.
- Re-evaluate regularly as models, data, or deployment contexts evolve.

## **R.1 Reporting and Visualization**

This section outlines recommended visualizations and reporting steps to communicate fairness audit findings effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### R.1.1 Visualization and Reporting

- Embed visuals directly in MDX (e.g., `![Description](path/to/image.png)`) to keep reports self-contained.
- Pair each chart with a short caption explaining metric, cohort, confidence interval, and escalation tier.

### R.1.2 Confidence-Based Escalation Thresholds

| Confidence Level | Escalation Tier | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **≥ 0.99** | Immediate Action | Trigger mitigation workflow |
| **≥ 0.95** | Investigation Required | Root-cause analysis + internal review |
| **≥ 0.90** | Enhanced Monitoring | Increase observation frequency |
| < 0.90 | Monitor | No immediate action |

### R.1.3 Compute Confidence Level

- Option A: Hypothesis testing → Confidence = 1 − p-value (e.g., p=0.01 → 99%).
- Option B: Bootstrap probability → % of resamples where disparity exceeds policy threshold.
- Always pair confidence with a minimum effect-size threshold to avoid overreacting to tiny gaps.

### R.1.4 Reporting Template

- Primary table: metric, point estimate, confidence interval, confidence level, escalation tier.
- Executive summary: headline risks and recommended actions.
- Visuals: disparity chart, intersectional heatmap, trade-off scatter, threshold alert chart (with CIs and tiers).
- Traceability: note data cut, model version, generation date, and link to the producing notebook/report.

### R.1.5 Governance Integration

- Tier 1 (≥0.99): Freeze/mitigate, notify compliance, executive review.
- Tier 2 (≥0.95): Subgroup drill-down, feature impact, threshold sensitivity checks.
- Tier 3 (≥0.90): Increase monitoring frequency and schedule re-evaluation.

### R.1.6 Suggested Chart Types

- Fairness Disparity Chart: group gaps with CIs and threshold lines.
- Intersectional Heatmap: subgroup disparities with significance/size cues.
- Pareto (Fairness/Technical): bars by impact with cumulative line.
- Fairness vs Technical Scatter: trade-offs (accuracy vs gap) with frontier.
- Threshold Alert Chart: bands for monitor/investigate/action.
- Metric Evolution: time series with intervention markers.
- Small Sample / Intersectional Uncertainty: bubble/dot plot encoding N and CI width.

### R.1.7 Notes

- Record data cut, model version, and generation date for each artifact.
- List metrics shown, confidence levels, thresholds applied, and sources of visuals.
