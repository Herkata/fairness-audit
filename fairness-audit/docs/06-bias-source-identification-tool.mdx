## **Bias Detection Methodology**

<aside>

### Step 1: Start with Historical Context

Begin by reviewing the results of your **Historical Context Assessment**.

Identify the bias patterns classified as **highest risk**, especially those tied to documented discrimination, structural inequities, or historically disadvantaged groups.

These patterns define where your investigation should begin.

---

### Step 2: Align with Selected Fairness Definitions

Next, revisit the **fairness definitions** you selected (e.g., Equal Opportunity, Demographic Parity, Calibration).

Ask:

- Which bias types directly undermine these fairness goals?
- Which biases could cause violations of your primary fairness metric?

This step ensures that detection efforts are not generic, but directly tied to your fairness commitments.

---

### Step 3: Prioritize High-Impact Bias Types

Focus detection efforts on bias categories that:

- 📚 Align with documented historical patterns
- ⚠️ Pose a direct risk to your selected fairness definitions
- 📊 Could materially affect system outcomes

Biases that satisfy **both historical relevance and fairness impact** should receive highest priority.

---

### Step 4: Document Bias–Fairness Connections

For each identified bias source:

- Clearly reference the **historical pattern** it relates to
- Explicitly state which **fairness definition** it threatens
- Describe the potential impact on system outcomes
- Record planned detection or mitigation actions

This documentation ensures transparency, traceability, and audit readiness.

## **Prioritization Framework**

### Assessment Dimensions

Each identified issue should be evaluated across the following standardized dimensions using a **1–5 scale**, where higher values indicate greater impact or relevance.

**Severity**

The magnitude of potential harm if the issue remains unresolved.

**Scope**

The extent to which decisions, outcomes, or individuals are affected.

**Persistence**

The likelihood that effects will accumulate or reinforce themselves over time (e.g., through feedback mechanisms).

**Intervention Feasibility**

The relative difficulty or ease of mitigating or resolving the issue.

**Historical Alignment**

The degree to which the issue aligns with previously identified structural or historical patterns.


### Priority Calculation

To determine overall prioritization, calculate a weighted score using the following formula:

$$
\text{Priority Score} = (\text{Severity} \times 0.3) \\
+ (\text{Scope} \times 0.2) \\
+ (\text{Persistence} \times 0.2) \\
+ (\text{Historical Alignment} \times 0.2) \\
+ (\text{Intervention Feasibility} \times 0.1)
$$

This weighting emphasizes potential harm while still accounting for breadth, long-term effects, contextual relevance, and practical constraints.


### Priority Categories

These categories support structured decision-making and resource allocation
- **High Priority:** Score ≥ 4.0
- **Medium Priority:** 3.0 ≤ Score < 4.0
- **Low Priority:** Score < 3.0
