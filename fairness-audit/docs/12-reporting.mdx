# Reporting and Visualization

## **1 Visualization and Reporting**

### 1.1 Image Embedding for Visualizations

To include images in your documentation, you can use the following syntax:

```mdx
![Description of the image](path/to/image.png)
```

## **2 Confidence-Based Escalation Thresholds**

### 2.1 Threshold Definitions

| Confidence Level | Escalation Tier | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **≥ 0.99** | 🔴 Immediate Action | Trigger mitigation workflow |
| **≥ 0.95** | 🟠 Investigation Required | Root-cause analysis + internal review |
| **≥ 0.90** | 🟡 Enhanced Monitoring | Increase observation frequency |
| < 0.90 | 🟢 Monitor | No immediate action |

## **3 Compute the Confidence Level**

You can derive this from:

### 3.1 Option A: Hypothesis Testing

- Confidence = 1 − p-value
    - p = 0.01 → 99% confidence
    - p = 0.05 → 95% confidence
    - p = 0.10 → 90% confidence

### 3.2 Option B: Bootstrap Probability

- % of bootstrap samples where disparity > 0 (or exceeds policy threshold)

Example:

- 99.3% of resamples show disparity > 0 → Immediate Action

## **4 Sample Report with Dummy Values**

### 4.1 Primary Metrics

| Metric | Point Estimate | 95% CI | Confidence | Escalation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demographic Parity Gap | 0.08 | [0.03, 0.13] | 0.97 | 🟠 Investigation |
| Equal Opportunity Gap | 0.05 | [0.01, 0.09] | 0.94 | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Worst-Group Error Gap | 0.15 | [0.09, 0.21] | 0.995 | 🔴 Immediate Action |

## **5 How This Improves Your Framework**

This does three important things:

1. Separates statistical strength from effect size
2. Prevents overreaction to weak signals
3. Creates objective governance triggers

## **6 Important: Pair Confidence with Effect Size**

Confidence alone is not enough.

You should define **minimum materiality thresholds**:

Example:

- Only escalate if:
    - Confidence ≥ threshold AND
    - Disparity ≥ 0.05 absolute difference

This prevents:

- Large confidence on tiny but meaningless gaps
- Small sample noise driving escalation

## **7 Visual Reporting Template (Recommended Layout)**

For each metric visualization:

- Dot = Point estimate
- Vertical line = CI
- Horizontal line = 0
- Shaded bands for:
    - 90% zone
    - 95% zone
    - 99% zone

Under chart:

> Confidence Level: 99.5%
>
>
> Escalation Tier: Immediate Action

## **8 Governance Integration**

You can formalize this as:

### 8.1 Tier 1 – Immediate Action (≥ 0.99)

- Freeze model version (if severe)
- Launch bias mitigation workflow
- Notify compliance
- Executive-level review

### 8.2 Tier 2 – Investigation (≥ 0.95)

- Subgroup drill-down
- Feature impact analysis
- Threshold sensitivity testing

### 8.3 Tier 3 – Monitoring (≥ 0.90)

- Increase reporting frequency
- Watch for trend amplification
- Schedule re-evaluation next cycle

## **9 Why This Tiering Is Strong**

It balances:

- Statistical rigor
- Operational practicality
- Regulatory defensibility
- Risk-based governance

It also prevents “fairness alarm fatigue.”

## **10 Suggested Chart Types**

### 10.1 Fairness Disparity Chart

- **Type:** Group-level bar chart
- **Purpose:** Show primary metrics (e.g., Demographic Parity Gap, Equal Opportunity Gap) across protected groups
- **Features:**
    - Confidence intervals (error bars)
    - Color-coded by statistical significance or escalation tiers
    - Reference lines for thresholds (monitor, investigate, immediate action)

<img src="/img/dummy-fairness-disparity.svg" alt="Fairness disparity demo" style={{maxWidth: '620px', width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '12px 0'}} />
Fairness gap per group; bars show group rates, dotted line is parity target, whiskers are CIs.

### 10.2 Intersectional Heatmap

- **Type:** Heatmap
- **Purpose:** Capture disparities across intersectional subgroups (e.g., race × gender × age)
- **Features:**
    - Color gradient = magnitude of disparity
    - Cell size or opacity = sample size
    - Optional: overlay significance markers

<img src="/img/dummy-intersectional-heatmap.svg" alt="Intersectional heatmap demo" style={{maxWidth: '620px', width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '12px 0'}} />
Rows = gender bands, columns = groups; colors encode disparity (green low, amber medium, red high).

### 10.3 Pareto Diagram of Fairness Metrics

- **Type:** Bar + cumulative line chart
- **Purpose:** Highlight which fairness metrics contribute most to overall disparity
- **Features:**
    - X-axis = metrics sorted by impact
    - Y-axis = magnitude of disparity (bars)
    - Right Y-axis = cumulative % contribution (line)
    - Color bars by escalation tier

<img src="/img/dummy-pareto-fairness.svg" alt="Pareto of fairness metrics demo" style={{maxWidth: '620px', width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '12px 0'}} />
Cumulative line shows coverage by top fairness gaps; bars are ordered by contribution.

### 10.4 Pareto Diagram of Technical Metrics

- **Type:** Bar + cumulative line chart
- **Purpose:** Prioritize technical issues (accuracy, calibration, F1 differences) by their contribution to performance gaps
- **Features:**
    - Same structure as fairness Pareto
    - Optional overlay = confidence in metrics

<img src="/img/dummy-pareto-technical.svg" alt="Pareto of technical metrics demo" style={{maxWidth: '620px', width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '12px 0'}} />
Same as fairness Pareto but for technical metrics (acc, AUC, F1, calibration, drift).

### 10.5 Fairness vs Technical Trade-Off Scatter Plot
